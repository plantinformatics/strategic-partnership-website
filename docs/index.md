# Australian Grains Genebank Strategic Partnership

![GRDC-AGG-AgVic-logos](https://pretzel-images-public.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/agvic_grdc.svg)

The AGG Strategic Partnership is a $30M joint investment between the Victorian State Government and Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) that aims to unlock the genetic potential of plant genetic resources for the benefit of the Australian grain growers.

The AGG has the mandate to acquire, conserve, maintain and distribute genetic resources to plant breeders and researchers to underpin the development of more resilient and productive grain crop varieties for the benefit of the Australian grains industry.

The AGGâ€™s ultimate goal is to unlock the genetic potential of plant genetic resources for cereal, oilseed and pulse crops to underpin the development of high yielding, climate resilient crops that will benefit Australian grain growers.

This page will be regularly updated with outputs from the Partnership, including information about datasets, digital tools, Community of Practice meeting and training sessions.

## Datasets

A core aim of the Partnership is the genetic characterisation of the AGG collection.

Genotype datasets are made available on Harvard Dataverse under a CC BY 4.0 license: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/australiangrainsgenebank-genotypedata

***Total genotypes released to date***: 37,666
